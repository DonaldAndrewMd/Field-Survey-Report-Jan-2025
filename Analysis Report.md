Among the variables analyzed, estimated wealth levels emerged as the only significant factor associated with maternal practice (p = 0.020, χ² = 15.058). Mothers from the poorest wealth level had the lowest representation in moderate practice (0.3%) but showed a slightly higher representation in good practice (2.7%). The second richest group had the highest proportion across all levels of maternal practice (55.8%), while the richest group accounted for the smallest percentage overall (4.0%).

Cramer's V value (0.156, p = 0.023) indicates a strong and statistically significant association between estimated wealth levels and maternal practice (Akoglu, 2018). Other variables, including mother’s age, geopolitical zone, educational level, religion, marital status, and occupation, were not statistically significant in relation to maternal practice.

Analysis revealed significant associations between knowledge levels and certain sociodemographic factors, including geopolitical zone, highest educational level, religion, and estimated wealth levels. Knowledge levels varied significantly across geopolitical zones (χ² = 25.741, p < 0.001). Respondents from the South were more likely to have good knowledge (59.5%) compared to those from the North (8.3%). The association strength was very strong, with a Cramer's V value of 0.292(p<0.001) (Akoglu, 2018).

Educational attainment showed a significant relationship with knowledge levels (χ² = 10.957, p = 0.04). Respondents with tertiary education exhibited better knowledge (19.3%) compared to those with non-tertiary education. The strength of this association, indicated by a Cramer's V value of 0.191(p=0.004), was strong (Akoglu, 2018). Religious affiliation also significantly influenced knowledge levels (G = 14.611, p = 0.006). Christianity was associated with a higher proportion of good knowledge (48.8%) compared to Islam (18.6%) and traditional religion (0.3%). The strength of this association was strong (Cramer's V = 0.156, P=0.006)(Akoglu, 2018).

Wealth levels were significantly associated with knowledge levels (G = 21.989, p = 0.001). Respondents in the second richest wealth category demonstrated the highest proportion of good knowledge (37.5%), followed by those in the third richest category (24.9%). The poorest and richest groups had the lowest proportions of good knowledge. The association strength was strong (Cramer's V = **0**.193, p=0.001) (Akoglu, 2018).

The table demonstrates the relationship between the respondents' knowledge level and their breastfeeding practices. The statistical test reveals a significant interaction between knowledge level and practice quality (G=10.551, p=0.032).

The **Cramer's V (0.118)** suggests a **weak to moderate association** between knowledge level and breastfeeding practices albeit non-significant(p>0.05) (Akoglu, 2018)
